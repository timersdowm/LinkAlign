Following is the whole table creation statement for the database popular_movies

Question: Which year has the least number of movies that was released and what is the title of the movie in that year that has the highest number of rating score of 1?
Hint: least number of movies refers to MIN(movie_release_year); highest rating score refers to MAX(SUM(movie_id) where rating_score = '1')
Analysis: Let’s think step by step. In the question , we are asked:
"Which year" so we need column = [movies.movie_release_year]
"number of movies" so we need column = [movies.movie_id]
"title of the movie" so we need column = [movies.movie_title]
"rating score" so we need column = [ratings.rating_score]
Hint also refers to the columns = [movies.movie_release_year, movies.movie_id, ratings.rating_score]
Based on the columns and tables, we need these Foreign_keys = [movies.movie_id = ratings.movie_id].
Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [1]. So the Schema_links are:
Answer: [movies.movie_release_year, movies.movie_title, ratings.rating_score, movies.movie_id,ratings.movie_id]

Question: Among the lists created by user 4208563, which one has the highest number of followers? Indicate how many followers it has and whether the user was a subscriber or not when he created the list.
Hint: User 4208563 refers to user_id;highest number of followers refers to MAX(list_followers); user_subscriber = 1 means that the user was a subscriber when he created the list; user_subscriber = 0 means the user was not a subscriber when he created the list (to replace)
Analysis: Let’s think step by step. In the question , we are asked:
"user" so we need column = [lists_users.user_id]
"number of followers" so we need column = [lists.list_followers]
"user was a subscriber or not" so we need column = [lists_users.user_subscriber]
Hint also refers to the columns = [lists_users.user_id,lists.list_followers,lists_users.user_subscriber]

Based on the tables, columns, and Foreign_keys, The set of possible cell values are = [1, 4208563]. So the Schema_links are:

### Analysis:
1、Understanding the Requirement:
   The question aims to identify a specific semester during which students from both Master’s and Bachelor’s degree programs were enrolled. 
   This involves finding commonality in enrollment periods for these two distinct groups of students.
2、Key Entities Identification:
  The question explicitly mentions four entities: "semester" and "Master students" and "Bachelor students" and "student enrollment" 
3、Entity Classification:
   Both "Master" and "Bachelor" students belong to a broader category known as the "degree class." 
   This class represents various types of academic programs offered by an educational institution.
4. Database Schema Deduction:
   The most likely database schemas that store information about degree programs and student enrollments.
     "degree_programs": contains details about different degree programs, including identifiers and names/descriptions of the programs (e.g., "Master" or "Bachelor").
     "student_enrolment": This schema captures the enrollment data, indicating which students are enrolled in which semesters and in what degree programs.

#
Question: Find the semester when both Master students and Bachelor students got enrolled in.
Analysis: Let's think step by step to determine the exact database corresponding to the question by using the provided database schemas.
Step 1: Key Requirements of the Question.We are tasked with finding the semester when both Master students and Bachelor students got enrolled.This implies that we need data about students' enrollments (Bachelor and Master), and semester information.
Step 2: Database Schemas Comparison.The student_transcripts_tracking schema directly links students to their degree programs and specific semesters. This schema allows us to distinguish between Bachelor's and Master's students, and the presence of the Semesters table enables precise filtering of enrollment data by semester, making it ideal for identifying when both groups were enrolled.The csu_1 schema lacks the necessary granularity for this query. It does not provide detailed semester data or a way to directly link students to their program type (Bachelor's or Master's). While it offers some aggregate enrollment information, it does not enable filtering based on specific semesters, making it insufficient for answering the query about when both Bachelor’s and Master’s students were enrolled together in a semester.
Step 3: Conclusion.The gold database is student_transcripts_tracking because it contains the required detailed data to answer the query about semester enrollments for both Master and Bachelor students.
Database Name: student_transcripts_tracking
